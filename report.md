# High Issues

## H-1: Uninitialized State Variables

Solidity does initialize variables by default when you declare them, however it's good practice to explicitly declare an initial value. For example, if you transfer money to an address we must make sure that the address has been initialized.

	```solidity
	    uint256 private s_currentLotteryId;
	```

</details>



## H-2: Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function.

It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.

	```solidity
	contract SmartLottery is VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus {
	```

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Lottery.sol [Line: 131](src/Lottery.sol#L131)

	```solidity
	    function createLottery(uint256 _lotteryId, uint256 _ticketPrice, uint256 _expiration) external onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Lottery.sol [Line: 3](src/Lottery.sol#L3)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event LotteryCreated(uint256 indexed lotteryId, uint256 ticketPrice, uint256 expiration, address operator);
	```

- Found in src/Lottery.sol [Line: 77](src/Lottery.sol#L77)

	```solidity
	    event WinnerPicked(uint256 indexed lotteryId, address indexed winner, uint256 prize);
	```

</details>



## L-4: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

## L-5: Modifiers invoked only once can be shoe-horned into the function
